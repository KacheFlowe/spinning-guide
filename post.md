> So we thought you are responsible enough to operate and track your own 
billable AirPair hours! Read this guide to save you and customers time
and confusion. The smoother you operating according to this guide the faster
you'll get paid and probably booked for another pair!

## 1. What is *Spinning*?

<!--### 1.1 Background-->

### 1.1 Origins

The term "Spinning" originally came from the usage: 

> "**Let me** ***spin*** **you up a** (google) **hangout** (for your AirPair session) **!**"

### 1.2 Evolution

These days AirPair `bookings` facilitate a broader set of services than 
the traditional live pairing (AirPair sessions). Bookings are a great way to get
paid without fuss across online and offline activities including but not 
limited to:

- (Online) 1-to-many Workshops
- (Online) Chat support
- (Offline) Prototyping / research
- (Offline) Code reviews
- (Offline) Coding / building for a client
- (Offline) Authoring guides / documentation 

***Spinning*** (in AirPair verbiage) has grown to encompases everything you 
can and should do to get paid as efficiently as possible leveraging our 
automated workflow once a customer has made a booking. This incorporates tasks leading up to being able to spin your actual pair session including:

- `Scheduling` and confirming to pair (or deliver offline services by).
- `Onboarding` new customers by answering questions and confirming their
setup to join your pairing session smoothly.

<!--
- - -
**Tip ** If you were familiar with the pre-2015 AirPair, `bookings` were 
designed to be totally seperate from `requests`. This means that customers
do not need to provide new requirements to rebook you. In fact, if a 
customer is familiar with you but not AirPair, you can be booked direclty 
without a customer needing to make a request.
-->

### 1.3 Ensuring you get paid

#### 1.3.1 Escrow

<!--Different actions are detailed for different booking types and
tools (if any) that your customer chooses when they book you.-->

**If all else fails, the step that ensures you get paid is getting customers 
to release payment from escrow** <sup>Release Payment Step as described in the expert guide</sup>. 

#### 1.3.2 Manage expectations up-front

Bookings represent funds collected for payment in advance. If there is no 
booking for the customer to release payment on, then you cannot get paid. It is 
your responsibility to make sure you have been booked full the full amount of
time with which you have expectations of being paid.

#### 1.3.3 Support from AirPair

Assuming you have been booked, everything below is best practice leading 
up to the customers responsibility to release your payment. The likely of 
getting assist from AirPair staff in situations where the customer has not 
immediately released payment after you've delivered service will be reflected
in how well you have followed the guidelines below.

### 2.0 Plaform in progress 

Most folks perceive AirPair as big company. It's currently run with lots of love 
{<3} by one person <sup>AirPair is happily profitable and will expand again towards end of 2016 when @jk sets up the new head office in Sydney, Australia</sup>. 
-->
<!--
We recognize the expert features of the site have been mostly incomplete since
the rebuild began<sup>The airpair.com rebuilt started in Q4, 2014</sup>. Good
news, is the experts features are the top prioirty of Q3/Q4 and many like the 
bulk deals and availability feature are just need a skin to become accesible
to you on the front-end.

Thank you reading and incorporating the details in this guide. Utilizing 
this info will save us time that will be dedicated to coding and releasing
features faster :)

## 2. Expectations & professionalism

Stick to these guidelines to avoid your AirPair `Mojo` <sup>The [Expert mojo api](https://github.com/airpair/experts.airpair.com/blob/master/docs/api/experts/mojo.md) and the number of pairs you get.</sup> and future success getting 
pairs being negatively impacted.

### 2.1 DON'T MISS SESSIONS

We will credit your customer $30 deduct that 
amount from your payouts. Missing multiple sessions will lead to no more 
pairing via AirPair.

### 2.2 AVOID RESCHEDULING

1. We expect you not to reschedule customers. 
2. If rescheduling is necessary it must be done with at least 24 hours notice.
3. Under exceptional circumstances (baby on the way / traffic jam etc.) 
**let your pair know *via your chat room* ** at least a half hour before why
you will not be able to attend. Via chat enables and sooner if possible helps
us potentially swap to an alternate expert.
4. Radio silence will likely lead to no more pairing via AirPair.
5. Stopping/breaking mid-session for more than 1-2 minutes (e.g. to take phone  calls) or change locations is not acceptable.
6. Ending early to reschedule will entitle the customer the original
full booking length at the rescheduled time, to swap experts without you
getting paid or a full refund.

### 2.3 WORKING AUDIO & VIDEO

We expect your audio and video to be working and clear. You are responsible
for having enough bandwidth and pre-testings that the audio and video are
not inhibiting communications ahead of time.

### 2.4 ON TIME IS EARLY

We respect expert time more than similar platform <sup>Unlike other platforms [AirPair favors experts](/expert-guide).</sup> Customers are made aware that
your time is important and that paid time starts ticking immediately from
your scheduled time.

You and your pair are asked to be online in your chat room **10 minutes before your session** to:

- To account for possible clock misalignment
- Buffer time to correctly set up 
- Last minute ping missing parties accidently distracted, but readily available if poked <sup>Sometimes we developers can get lost in code and not notice the time/</sup>.

### 2.5 Late customers & no-shows

Experts have no obligation to stay later than the scheduled time, even if a 
customer is ready a few minutes late.

If a customer is later than 15 minutes and you your session recording started
on time, you may end the call and collect payment for the full booking by
mentioning @customer-service in your chat room to let us know.

### 2.6 STICK TO PAID TIME

With no expectations, we are happy for you to go up to 15 minutes overtime 
if you are eager and going to successfully wrap up with a few extra minutes.

If you think it will take more than an extra 15 minutes, 5 minutes before 
the end of the original session length ask if the customer if they wish
to book more time. Otherwise solved or not, we expect you to have wrapped up 
by 15 minutes over.

Providing free follow on time is frowned upon. You should be able to accurately 
set expectations before being booked. Most scenarios around experts wanting to 
give additional free time have resulted from missing expert knowledge which
ultimately reflects poorly on the platform. If not 100% confident, do not 
volunteer to avoid mis-aligned customer expectations.

Customers sometime try to extract value in chat before the actual paid session.
Use your intuition for answering pre-session questions to setup your success 

## 3. Tools for live pairing sessions

### 3.1 With new customers

Live Pairing sessions by default are conducted through **AirPair Integrated 
Google Hangouts** on Air. We encourage Hangouts for first interactions as the video is better for building initial human connection / trust. 

Hangouts are currently the only system integrated into our automated workflow. 
Recordings are automatically given to the customer in the airpair.com UI for
reference. They also help resolve disputes and track fulfilment. 

New customers are just getting introduced to ideas like escrow. Sticking to the 
flow particularly increases the efficiency and certainty with which you get 
paid.

<!--Unless you are an experience expert (worked with more than 5 customers) and
your next customer has also used AirPair before, using hangouts on your first
pair is required.-->

### 3.2 With return customers

#### 3.2.1 Whatever works

After the first session we recommend you use the pairing/ screen-sharing 
tool of choice between you and the customer.

#### 3.2.2 When to stick with Hangouts

If the customer wants a recordings accessible from their AirPair dashboard, 
it is best to continue with hangouts. Hangouts are also great for multiple
attendees.

<!--#### 3.2.3 Keeping things automated

Hacking the workflow, just spin a hangout anyway.-->

## 4. Spinning your own Hangouts

### 4.1 Use our integrated workflow !!

** Our custom flow**:
- Will save you time automatically setting up details like inviting the 
right emails.
- Integrates with and updates your chat room and the airpair.com UI.
- Triggers *@pairbot* to follow up with customers until the release your pay.

** Do not create a normal hangout via chat / g+ or slack as**:
- Recordings will not be accessible to the customer via our system.
- We are unlikely help release payments if an integrated hangout wasn't created and properly tracked.

### 4.2 Instructions & Confirmation

#### 4.2.1 The (secret) entrance

**!! Self-spinning only works from 25 minutes before through 15 minutes after
your confirmed session time.** Outside this time range or logged in with the 
wrong email address (e.g. a different google account not associated with the 
booking) you will see a blank page.

To begin enter the self spinning flow, take your booking url and add `/spin` at
the end. For example if your booking were at:

<pre>
https://www.airpair.com/bookings/54fe3005058e3f0c003218ac
</pre>

The following urls logged in as you will both enter the flow:
<pre>
https://www.airpair.com/bookings/54fe3005058e3f0c003218ac<b style="color:#c7254e">/spin</b>

http://booking.airpa.ir/54fe3005058e3f0c003218ac<b style="color:#c7254e">/spin</b>
</pre>

The feature is self documented. It is very straightforward if you are
aware of the Gotchas in the next section.

#### 4.2.1 On-time creation and recording

Both the time you create and begin recording are recorded captured by the 
Hangouts API and saved as data for the Mojo API <sup>4</sup>.

** 10 mins before ** your Hangout *should* be ready to provide a buffer 
for special use cases in covered in (4.4) and troubleshooting covered in (4.5). 

A link will automatically shared by @pairbot 10 minutes before. ** If you do not
see @pairbot sharing a link to confirm things are setup right, you probably
missed something and should start again

<!-- Insert screenshot here -->

** By the confirm time **, press the "Start Broadcast" button to
begin recording. If you are your pair are set up and ready begin recording
early. If your pair is not present or still setting up, begin recording 
when the clock hits the confirmed time.

** Tip 1 ** If your first time self spinning, set up your hangout 20 minutes
before. Once familiar it should take comfortably less than 3 minutes.
- - -
** Tip 2 ** If your customer explicitly asks you not to record the hangout
because for IP or code privacy, please record the beginning of the hangout 
then press "Stop broadcast" when you begin to cover sensitive information. 
- - -
** Tip 3 ** Historically customers uncomfortable with / refusing to use video
have caused problems. Try flag if the customer has issues with 
@customer-service during onboarding and not at the last moment.

### 4.3 Gotchas

1) Even though the self-spin flow invites your personal email to the hangout, 
**user 1 hangout window** as the @airpair.com account you login with. 2 hangout
windows will cause an echo. Closing the incognito @airpair.com window and 
re-joining with your personal g+ email will stop the recording.

2) Remember to **open a fresh incognito window** with link you get given in
the second step. If you had another incognito window still lying around and
signed into an existing google account, the integration will fail and you will
not see pairbot share the link in chat.

3) **Popup Blockers** and AdBlockers may hinder the hangout API from opening 
a new window for the Hangout.

### 4.4 Special use-cases

Eventually these scenarios will be automated, customers have been told in
"the fine print" on the booking page to flag these situations in chat ahead
of time.

To add additional emails, after you've started your hangout manually click 
invites in the hangout UI and paste in the additional emails they provide.

<!-- Insert invite pictures -->

#### 4.4.1 Alternate g+ friendly emails 

Often customers sign up with email addresses or corporate accounts that are
not g+ enabled and thus cannot be used to access the hangout. Ask the customer for a alternate (usually personal gmail) address and manually invite that
address from the hangout UI.

#### 4.4.2 Additional participants

Manually invite addresses from the hangout UI that are provided for colleagues
to join.

#### 4.4.3 Duplicate accounts

Occasionally users

### 4.5 Troubleshooting hangouts

Hangouts can be flakey and even experienced experts and we've watched 
experienced experts have random difficulties that delayed sessions starting. 
Most issues are solved with:

1. (First call) Confirming the customer is logged into google and joining
as the same email address on the booking.
2. (2nd call) Quitting and reopening the browser
3. (3rd call) Trying a different browser
3. (Last resort) Rebooting

## 5 Follow up

### Priority 3 - ONBOARDING new Participants

You will get an email when a new booking is made. Make sure that
booking is associated with either a new room you create or an existing one.

Open the link in the email.

** Create a new room (group) **

Sometimes the expert is not yet part of our slack.. Invite them using the
invite to slack.

If you invited them already and after 2 hours they are not in slack
send a manual email from gmail asking them to sign in.

To see when users have joined slack, go to airpair-channel and look
down the bottom.

** Associate an existing room (group) **

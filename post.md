> So we thought you are responsible enough to operate and track your own 
billable AirPair hours! Read this guide to save you and customers time
and confusion. The smoother you operating according to this guide the faster
you'll get paid and probably booked for another pair!

## 1. What is ***Spinning*** ?

<!--### 1.1 Background-->

### 1.1 Origins & Evolution

The term *Spinning* originally came from the usage: 

> "**Let me** ***spin*** **you up a** google **hangout** for your AirPair session!"

These days AirPair `bookings` facilitate a broader set of services than 
the traditional live pairing session. AirPair Bookings are a way to get
paid without fuss for online and offline software services including but not 
limited to:

- 1-to-many Workshops (Online via Hangouts) 
- Chat support (Online via Slack) 
- Prototyping / research (Offline)
- Code reviews (Offline via GitHub) 
- Coding / building for a client (Offline) 
- Authoring guides / tutorials / documentation (Offline potentially on airpair.com) 

<!--
***Spinning*** (in AirPair verbiage) has grown to encompases everything you 
can and should do to get paid as efficiently as possible leveraging our 
automated workflow once a customer has made a booking. This incorporates tasks leading up to being able to spin your actual pair session including:

- `Scheduling` and confirming to pair (or deliver offline services by).
- `Onboarding` new customers by answering questions and confirming their
setup to join your pairing session smoothly.
-->

<!--

**Tip ** If you were familiar with the pre-2015 AirPair, `bookings` were 
designed to be totally seperate from `requests`. This means that customers
do not need to provide new requirements to rebook you. In fact, if a 
customer is familiar with you but not AirPair, you can be booked direclty 
without a customer needing to make a request.
-->

### 1.2 Getting paid (via Escrow)

If you train customers well and follow the flow, AirPair facilitates you being 
paid instantly for completed work increments of your preferred between 30 mins 
& 20 hrs.

1.2.1 ** Happy customer == instant pay **

<!--Different actions are detailed for different booking types and
tools (if any) that your customer chooses when they book you.-->

If all else fails, the single step that still ensures you get paid is getting
when your customers `release` payment for a booking from escrow <sup>Release Payment Step as described in the expert guide</sup>. 

1.2.2 ** Manage bookings up-front **

Bookings represent funds collected and already set aside in escrow for payment 
to you. If there is no booking, you cannot get paid. AirPair will not 
retroactively ask customers to create bookings for payment you claim you
are owed. It is your responsibility to make sure you are booked for the full
amount of time with which you have expectations of being paid for.

1.2.3 ** Follow the guides **

The likelihood of getting assistance from AirPair staff in situations where 
payment is not immediately released will be reflected in how well you have 
followed the guidelines outlined in the Expert Guide <sup>AirPair [Expert Guide](/expert-guide)</sup> and sections below.

## 2. Expectations & professionalism

Your AirPair `Mojo` <sup>The [Expert mojo api](https://github.com/airpair/experts.airpair.com/blob/master/docs/api/experts/mojo.md) and the number of pairs you get.</sup> and future success in getting 
pairs is tightly bound with sticking in these boundaries.

### 2.1 Showing up

We will deduct $30 from your payouts and credit your customer each time you
miss a session. Missing multiple sessions will quickly the number of new 
pairing opportunties we send you drop towards nil.

### 2.2 Rescheduling

You are generally expected not to reschedule customers, but if necessarily
to work within the following boundaries:

1. If rescheduling is necessary you must notify your customer and 
@customer-support via chat with at least 24 hours notice.
2. Under exceptional circumstances (baby on the way / traffic jam etc.) 
**let your pair know *via your chat room* ** at least a half hour before why
you will not be able to attend.
3. Radio silence leading up to and past your scheduled time will likely lead to no more pairing.
4. Stopping /breaking mid-session for more than 1-2 minutes (e.g. to take phone  calls) or change locations is not acceptable.
5. Ending early to reschedule will entitle the customer to the original
full booking length at the rescheduled time or to swap and try a new expert 
without you getting paid or a full refund.

** Tip ** The sooner you let your customer and us know (via chat) that you 
cannot make a session the greater chance there is to find and swap to an alternate expert.

### 2.3 Audio & Video

We expect your audio and video to be working and clear. You are responsible
for having enough bandwidth and pre-testings ahead of time and that the audio 
and video are not inhibiting communications.

### 2.4 Punctuality

**{ ON TIME IS EARLY }**

We respect expert time more than similar platforms <sup>Unlike other platforms [AirPair favors experts](/expert-guide).</sup>. Customers are made aware that
your time is precious and the clock starts ticking immediately from at your scheduled time.

Be online in your chat room **10 minutes before your session** to:

- To account for clock misalignment
- Buffer time for smooth set up 
- Last minute ping missing parties accidently distracted, but readily available if poked <sup>Sometimes we developers can get lost in code and not notice the time/</sup>.

### 2.5 Late customers & no-shows

By being on-time, you also have no obligation to stay later than scheduled, even if customers are a few minutes late.

When your session recording has started on time, and a customer is later than 
15 minutes, you may end the call and collect your full booking payment after
mentioning @customer-service in chat to let alter of the no-show.

### 2.6 Stick to PAID time

With no expectations, if you need a few extra minutes and are eager to user them 
to successfully wrap up a session we are ok for you to go up to 15 minutes.

If you think it will take more than an extra 15 minutes, 5 minutes before 
the end of the original session end, ask the customer if they wish
to book more time <sup>See Rebooking in the Expert Guide</sup>. Solved or not, 
if a customer does not wish to rebook, we expect you to wrapped up no later 
than 15 minutes over.

Providing free time is frowned upon. Most scenarios around experts wanting to 
give additional follow on free time result from lack of expertise which
ultimately reflects poorly on the platform and often agrovate customers. 
Only volunteer on requirements you are very confident with. Customers sometimes 
try to extract value in chat before the actual paid sessions. Use your 
intuition to chat for enough time to answer pre-session questions to set 
yourself up for success. Do not spend unaccounted hours going through the 
customers code and necessary book offline time.

## 3. Tools for AirPairing Sessions

Live Pairing sessions by default are conducted through **AirPair Integrated 
Google Hangouts** on Air. Hangouts are currently the only system integrated into our automated workflow. Recordings are automatically given to the customer in the airpair.com UI for reference. They also help resolve disputes and track fulfilment. 

### 3.1 New customers

We encourage Hangouts for first interactions as the video great for building initial human connection / trust. 

AirPair has a money back-gaurantee <sup>See AirPair's Refund Policy for deatils on Money Back Gaurantee</sup> for the first hour with any new 
expert and new customers are just getting introduced to ideas like escrow. 
Sticking to the basic automatated flow with new customers particularly 
increases the efficiency and reduces risk of getting paid.

### 3.2 With return customers

#### 3.2.1 Pairing tool of choice

After the first session we recommend you use the pairing/ screen-share 
tool of choice between you and your customer.

#### 3.2.2 Why stick with Hangouts?

1. If the customer wants recordings accessible from their AirPair dashboard 
2. If additional participants are required


## 4. Spin your own Hangout

### 4.1 Use our integrated workflow !!

** Our custom flow**:
- Will save you time automatically setting up details like inviting the 
right emails.
- Integrates with and updates your chat room and the airpair.com UI.
- Triggers *@pairbot* to follow up with customers until the release your pay.

** Do not create a normal hangout via chat / g+ or slack as**:
- Recordings will not be accessible to the customer via our system.
- We are unlikely help release payments if an integrated hangout wasn't created and properly tracked.

### 4.2 Instructions & Confirmation

#### 4.2.1 The (secret) entrance

**!! Self-spinning only works from 25 minutes before through 15 minutes after
your confirmed session time.** Outside this time range or logged in with the 
wrong email address (e.g. a different google account not associated with the 
booking) you will see a blank page.

To begin enter the self spinning flow, take your booking url and add `/spin` at
the end. For example if your booking were at:

<pre>
https://www.airpair.com/bookings/54fe3005058e3f0c003218ac
</pre>

The following urls logged in as you will both enter the flow:
<pre>
https://www.airpair.com/bookings/54fe3005058e3f0c003218ac<b style="color:#c7254e">/spin</b>

http://booking.airpa.ir/54fe3005058e3f0c003218ac<b style="color:#c7254e">/spin</b>
</pre>

The feature is self documented. It is very straightforward if you are
aware of the Gotchas in the next section.

#### 4.2.1 On-time creation and recording

Both the time you create and begin recording are recorded captured by the 
Hangouts API and saved as data for the Mojo API <sup>4</sup>.

** 10 mins before ** your Hangout *should* be ready to provide a buffer 
for special use cases in covered in (4.4) and troubleshooting covered in (4.5). 

A link will automatically shared by @pairbot 10 minutes before. ** If you do not
see @pairbot sharing a link to confirm things are setup right, you probably
missed something and should start again

<!-- Insert screenshot here -->

** By the confirm time **, press the "Start Broadcast" button to
begin recording. If you are your pair are set up and ready begin recording
early. If your pair is not present or still setting up, begin recording 
when the clock hits the confirmed time.

** Tip 1 ** If your first time self spinning, set up your hangout 20 minutes
before. Once familiar it should take comfortably less than 3 minutes.
- - -
** Tip 2 ** If your customer explicitly asks you not to record the hangout
because for IP or code privacy, please record the beginning of the hangout 
then press "Stop broadcast" when you begin to cover sensitive information. 
- - -
** Tip 3 ** Historically customers uncomfortable with / refusing to use video
have caused problems. Try flag if the customer has issues with 
@customer-service during onboarding and not at the last moment.

### 4.3 Gotchas

1) Even though the self-spin flow invites your personal email to the hangout, 
**user 1 hangout window** as the @airpair.com account you login with. 2 hangout
windows will cause an echo. Closing the incognito @airpair.com window and 
re-joining with your personal g+ email will stop the recording.

2) Remember to **open a fresh incognito window** with link you get given in
the second step. If you had another incognito window still lying around and
signed into an existing google account, the integration will fail and you will
not see pairbot share the link in chat.

3) **Popup Blockers** and AdBlockers may hinder the hangout API from opening 
a new window for the Hangout.

### 4.4 Special use-cases

Eventually these scenarios will be automated, customers have been told in
"the fine print" on the booking page to flag these situations in chat ahead
of time.

To add additional emails, after you've started your hangout manually click 
invites in the hangout UI and paste in the additional emails they provide.

<!-- Insert invite pictures -->

#### 4.4.1 Alternate g+ friendly emails 

Often customers sign up with email addresses or corporate accounts that are
not g+ enabled and thus cannot be used to access the hangout. Ask the customer for a alternate (usually personal gmail) address and manually invite that
address from the hangout UI.

#### 4.4.2 Additional participants

Manually invite addresses from the hangout UI that are provided for colleagues
to join.

#### 4.4.3 Duplicate accounts

Occasionally users

### 4.5 Troubleshooting hangouts

Hangouts can be flakey and even experienced experts and we've watched 
experienced experts have random difficulties that delayed sessions starting. 
Most issues are solved with:

1. (First call) Confirming the customer is logged into google and joining
as the same email address on the booking.
2. (2nd call) Quitting and reopening the browser
3. (3rd call) Trying a different browser
3. (Last resort) Rebooting

### Priority 3 - ONBOARDING new Participants

You will get an email when a new booking is made. Make sure that
booking is associated with either a new room you create or an existing one.

Open the link in the email.

** Create a new room (group) **

Sometimes the expert is not yet part of our slack.. Invite them using the
invite to slack.

If you invited them already and after 2 hours they are not in slack
send a manual email from gmail asking them to sign in.

To see when users have joined slack, go to airpair-channel and look
down the bottom.

** Associate an existing room (group) **
